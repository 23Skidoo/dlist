Name:                dlist
Version:             0.3.2
Synopsis:            Differences lists
Description:         
    Differences lists: a list-like type supporting O(1) append.
    This is particularly useful for efficient logging and pretty
    printing, (e.g. with the Writer monad), where list append 
    quickly becomes too expensive.
